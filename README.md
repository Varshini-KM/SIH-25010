## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>The proposed solution addresses the critical gap in agricultural advisory services for small and marginal farmers through the establishment of "Farm Doctor" standalone AI-powered agricultural advisory kiosks. These innovative kiosks combine artificial intelligence technology with user-friendly physical infrastructure to provide accessible, reliable, and personalized farming guidance to rural communities.</h3>

The solution consists of three integrated components:
<b>1. "Farm Doctor" Standalone Kiosks</b>

These kiosks are weatherproof, self-service stations installed at central points in villages. They act as mini extension centers where farmers can consult on crop selection, pest management, soil health, irrigation, and fertilizer usage without needing a smartphone or internet connection.

For example, a smallholder in a rain-fed village notices some unusual leaf spots on her tomato crop. She takes a photo at the kiosk, and the AI immediately identifies a fungal infection. The system provides step-by-step treatment instructions in her language and prints a small card for her to reference while treating the crops at home. Such kiosks ensure even low-literate farmers can easily follow scientific advice and make informed decisions, reducing guesswork and potential crop loss

<b>2. Intelligent Problem-Solving System</b>

At the core of the kiosk is an AI engine using computer vision and machine learning. The system analyzes crop and soil images to detect pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies. It cross-references local weather data, soil health records, and historical crop patterns to provide personalized recommendations.

For instance, during the monsoon, a farmer notices early signs of whitefly infestation in his maize field. The AI not only identifies the pest but also predicts likely spread based on rainfall, temperature, and wind patterns. It then suggests preventive measures like targeted pesticide application and crop spacing adjustments, avoiding major crop loss. This ensures advice is field-specific rather than generic, improving both yields and cost efficiency.

<b>3. Interactive Communication Platform</b>

Understanding that literacy and language can be barriers, the kiosks provide voice-guided instructions in multiple regional languages, visual icons, and printed outputs. Large tactile buttons and simple navigation make it easy for farmers to interact with the system.

For example, a woman farmer who cannot read interacts with the kiosk in her native language. The system identifies nitrogen deficiency in her soil, displays an icon representing the appropriate fertilizer, prints a recommendation card, and even schedules an audio reminder to apply the fertilizer in three days. This ensures timely and accurate execution of farming tasks.

<h3>How It Addresses the Problem</h3>
1. Personalized Advisory Access: Each farmer receives guidance specific to their field’s soil, crop, and weather. For example, soil tests at the kiosk recommend precise fertilizer types and amounts, reducing costs and environmental impact.

2. Overcoming Literacy & Language Barriers: Voice instructions, visual cues, and printed cards ensure even low-literate farmers can follow guidance.

3. Technology Accessibility: Offline AI processing and solar-powered kiosks guarantee uninterrupted service, addressing rural internet connectivity challenges.

4. Building Trust: Physical presence in familiar locations, coupled with visible success stories, builds credibility and encourages adoption.

<h3>Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution</h3>
1. Physical-Digital Hybrid Approach: Unlike mobile app-based solutions, Farm Doctor combines advanced AI technology with physical accessibility, addressing both infrastructure limitations and user comfort preferences simultaneously
2. Zero-Learning Technology Interface: The kiosk design eliminates the need for farmers to learn new technology skills. Simple visual navigation, voice guidance, and familiar consultation workflow ensure immediate usability without training requirements
3. Instant Problem Resolution: Real-time diagnostic capabilities provide immediate solutions for urgent agricultural issues such as pest identification, disease outbreaks, or soil deficiencies,Unlike traditional extension services, which may require days or weeks for advice, farmers can get timely recommendations on how to act.
4. Continuous Learning Network: Each kiosk collects information on the problems reported and the solutions applied. Over time, this helps improve the accuracy and usefulness of the recommendations across all kiosks, allowing the system to offer more informed guidance based on practical experience.


## Technical Approach
<h3>Technologies to be Used</h3>
1. Software Development
Backend: Django 4.2 with Python 3.11 for managing data and server processes.
